# ðŸ¦€ Rust Crypto CLI Tools

This is a Rust workspace containing multiple command-line tools for learning, implementing, and analyzing various cryptographic techniques. Each module corresponds to a cryptography lecture or concept, implemented as a separate Rust binary crate.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Interactive CLI**: Intuitive command-line interface built with the `clap` crate for straightforward usage.
- **File Support**: Easily read input from and write output to files, making it script- and automation-friendly.
- **Modular Architecture**: Designed for extensibility â€” new cryptographic tools can be added with minimal effort.


### âœ… Progress Tracker

- [x] **Additiv** - Additive cipher implementation and analysis.
- [x] **VigenÃ¨re** - VigenÃ¨re cipher CLI tool with encryption/decryption.
- [x] **Betriebsmodi** - Block cipher modes of operation (ECB, CBC, etc.).
- [x] **AES** - Implementation or interface for AES encryption.
- [x] **SchlÃ¼sselgenerierung** - Key generation algorithms and utilities.
